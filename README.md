# fish-docs
Model for community gathering of information to improve software documentation

    Give a man a fish and he'll live for a day.
    Teach him how to fish and he'll live a lifetime.

Ask a question in a forum or chat room. It gets answered. That exchange becomes buried in an archive. With luck it's searchable, and others will find the Q&A, solve the issue of the moment, and move on with their lives. But why do we search forums and chat rooms for answers? Why do we post questions in forums? It's because the answers are either not in documentation, or perhaps the answers are difficult to find.

Sure, there are people who don't bother to read docs, don't bother to search forums, and they'll ask the same question within some number of minutes, hours, or days after someone else. To them, their time is important, and the time of other people is not. Let's acknowledge that these people will always exist and dismiss them from this discussion.

The rest of us are now spending a huge amount of our time researching details in a tech world that changes VERY fast. Everything is now a research project. We are doing our homework as independently as possible, and still not finding good answers. 

The better scenario is when we look at the official docs, find our answers, and get on with the actual task we're trying to complete.

The disconnection here is that FOSS developers often don't provide adequate documentation. There's usually no time. We have other things to do in life, like earning money to stay alive. Development time needs to be split between code and support - docs fall down the list.

<details><summary>What it is</summary>

This repo is an experiment with a new concept called "fish-docs"...

A new doc repo is created for an existing software repo. The name is the original name with "-docs" added ... so whatever "foo" does, we get "foo-docs".

The goal of fish-docs is to serve as a model which can be applied to the documentation for any software. It starts with people who use the software explaining a problem they are trying to solve, and verifying that the solution is hard to find. With some discussion and insight from people who know the software, a proposal is created to improve the documentation for the software.

This is not a new concept. Documentation for many products is now being curated in GitHub repositories, outside of silos curated by tech writers. The documentation is treated a first-class component, subject to the same kind of discussions, Git management, and updates as software. A fish-doc repo is just another way to organize that process.

Participation from software authors is not required. This is not intended to add even more tasks to long lists of tasks that we all have already. Actually, the model is intended to be used by everyone but the author. Of course author participation can dramatically reduce the time from question to answer, and then to documentation and other product improvements.

We're trying to discourage people from simply asking for answers to get them through each day. We are not giving "fish" as answers here, and  We want to ensure that there are answers for everyone in a sea of documentation.

### Authors/Developers:

Please don't discourage your users from creating or using fish-docs. Most of us don't have the time to write and maintain good docs. If we can't get others to contibute code, let them contribute their experience outside of forums where all of that data gets buried in temporal archives. Embrace the concept and encourage people to help document your software. Keep an eye on the questions but don't feel compelled to jump to answer questions. Remember: Teach them how to fish, don't be eager to give them fish. We're here to fix your documentation for everyone, not just answer a question for one person. Learn where your docs need improvement and spend some time there whenever you can. Recognize that a community where people are eager to discuss your software is a healthy community. Appreciate the time that people want to dedicate to _your_ software.

### Software users:

If you like this model for collaborative documention, please copy the model for other projects. You don't need to know anything about code. Make this a part of your pay-forward/pay-back for the FOSS and other software that you use. Get others involved to contribute their knowledge in an organized and productive manner. Help other projects to improve their documentation by curating Q&A and translating the effort into a useful part of the offering. If you do employ this model, please let us know.

### All

If you believe this model is flawed, please create a ticket, explain your perspective, and offer a suggestion for improvement. Is this a great idea? Dumb? Poorly implemented? Needs a tweak? Create a ticket. Explain why. Let's improve it. Get the idea?


<details><summary>Using fish-docs</summary>

Create a new repo. Replace the content of README.md with fish-doc-README.md and modify the details to suit the project. See [https://github.com/TonyGravagno/rspamd-docs](https://github.com/TonyGravagno/rspamd-docs) as an (and so far the only) example.
